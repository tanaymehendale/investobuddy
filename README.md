# Investobuddy

InvestoBuddy is an investment analysis tool that blends value investing principles with machine learning to help investors make informed decisions. It calculates the intrinsic value of stocks using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) + Monte Carlo simulations and predicts 6-month market trends using LSTM neural networks.


## Features
 - Fetches 5 years of historical financial & stock data via Alpha Vantage / Yahoo Finance APIs
 - Performs intrinsic valuation using DCF and Monte Carlo simulation
 - Builds LSTM neural network models to forecast 6-month price trends
 - Benchmarks against Random Forest for comparison
 - Provides buy/sell signals when intrinsic value diverges from market price
 - Interactive Flask + Angular webapp for end-users

## Tech Stack

 - Languages: Python, Angular (frontend)
 - Frameworks & Libraries: Flask, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, PyTorch
 - APIs: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance
 - Models: Monte Carlo Simulation, LSTM, Random Forest
 - Visualization: Matplotlib

Note: This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.
